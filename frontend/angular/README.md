# Elo manager frontend

This project serves as a tool for coding interviews, featuring a user interface for managing chess Elo ratings. It supports integration with various backends or can be used with a mock server. The presence of bugs, code requiring refactoring, or any missing or malfunctioning tests is by design, serving as concealed exercises meant for identification and resolution by the user.

## Development server

Run `ng run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can proxy to every backend. Just use these commands for the different beackends
- `ng run start:mock` -> Mock Server Backend
- `ng run start:spring:kotlin` -> Spring Boot Kotlin Backend
- `ng run start:spring:java` -> Spring Boot Java Backend
- `ng run start:csharp` -> C# Backend

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
