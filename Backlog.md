# UseCases

## Use Case 1: Unique user names

When a user with the same user name is created a appropriate error should be returned

- The error should be a 400
- The error should be a json object with the following format:

```json
{
    "error": "User name already exists"
}
```

- The error should be returned when a user is created with a user name that already exists

## Use Case 2: Elo calculations

When a match is created the elo of the players should be updated.

- The elo of the winner should be increased
- The elo of the loser should be decreased
- The increase/decrease should be based on the difference in elo between the players
- There is a maximum elo change of 42
- The maximum is used when the difference in elo is greater than 200

## Use Case 3: Query match history

When a user requests their match history the server should return the appropriate data

- Data should include:
    - Opponent
    - Outcome
    - Date
    - Elo change
- The data should be sorted by date
- The data should be limited to the last 10 matches

## Use Case 4: Query user stats

- Data should include:
    - Total wins
    - Total losses

- Data should include:
    - Opponent
    - Elo
